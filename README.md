# Fuzzy Inference
A Fuzzy Inference based prediction model for predicting number of customers attending a theme parks based on the weather.

[Skfuzzy](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/) librabry is used for fuzzy logic tools, like fuzzification, defuzzification and evaluation. 

Member functions used for fuzzilogic is the triangular member function. 
For evalution the Mamdani model is used along with centre of gravity method used for defuzzification. 

Newly added relations to the dataset influene the results for better relatioship functions.
